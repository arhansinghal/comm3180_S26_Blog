    "text": "Every March, we, the students of UPenn, face the same question: do we escape Philly for Spring Break, or just stick it out? Flights are expensive, beaches are crowded, and sometimes it’s actually not that bad at home.\nBut is that really? Is it not too bad or are we just lying to ourselves? Theres one way to know!\nTo find out, I looked at 21 years of weather data (2005–2025) from Philadelphia and asked a simple question:\nWhat is Spring Break generally like here?\nWILL IT BE?\n\n\n\nGorgeous Spring\n\n\nOR ALTERNATIVELY STILL?\n\n\n\nPainfully cold\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"philadelphia_weather_2005_to_2025.csv\")\ndf[\"date\"] = pd.to_datetime(df[\"date\"])\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\nday\nyear\nhigh\nlow\nrain\nsnow\nday_num\nmonth_num\ndow\ndow_name\nmonth\n\n\n\n\n0\n2005-01-01\nJanuary 1\n2005\n50\n39\n0.00\n0.0\n1\n1\n5\nSaturday\nJanuary\n\n\n1\n2005-01-02\nJanuary 2\n2005\n43\n35\n0.00\n0.0\n2\n1\n6\nSunday\nJanuary\n\n\n2\n2005-01-03\nJanuary 3\n2005\n36\n30\n0.01\n0.1\n3\n1\n0\nMonday\nJanuary\n\n\n3\n2005-01-04\nJanuary 4\n2005\n32\n27\n0.00\n0.0\n4\n1\n1\nTuesday\nJanuary\n\n\n4\n2005-01-05\nJanuary 5\n2005\n32\n22\n0.00\n0.0\n5\n1\n2\nWednesday\nJanuary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf.shape\n\n(7665, 12)\n\n\nThats 7665 days!

We’ve now only filtered for our desired dates from the entire dataset. This makes finding patterns we actually care about much easier. Lets see how that has changed our data\n\nspring_break.shape\n\n(189, 12)\n\n\nIn the past 21 years, we have 189 days of weather to inform us about what this year is going to look like. Lets quickly answer some questions.\n\nWhat is the coldest it has been and when?\nWhat is the warmest it has been and when?\nHow often has it rained? and How much?\nHow often has it snowed? and How much?\n\n\ncoldest_day = spring_break.loc[spring_break[\"low\"].idxmin(),'date']\nwarmest_day = spring_break.loc[spring_break[\"high\"].idxmax(),'date']\nrainy_days = spring_break[spring_break[\"rain\"] &gt; 0].shape[0]\namount_of_rain = spring_break['rain'].sum()\namount_of_snow = spring_break['snow'].sum()\n\nprint(f'The coldest day in the past springs was {coldest_day}')\nprint(f'The warmest day in the past springs was {warmest_day}')\nprint(f'It has rained {rainy_days} in past spring breaks for a total of {amount_of_rain} inches')\nprint(f'It has snowed for a total of {amount_of_snow} inches')\n\nThe coldest day in the past springs was 2005-03-09 00:00:00\nThe warmest day in the past springs was 2005-03-10 00:00:00\nIt has rained 0 in past spring breaks for a total of 0.0 inches\nIt has snowed for a total of 0.0 inches\n\n\n\nWhat is the coldest it has been and when? 9th March, 2005 30 degrees\nWhat is the warmest it has been and when? 10th March, 2005 68 degrees\nHow often has it rained? and How much? It has never rained, how crazy is that!\nHow often has it snowed? and How much? Never snowed\n\nLets now figure out how warm/cold it might be nonetheless on average!\n\nhigh_average = spring_break['high'].sum()/189\nlow_average = spring_break['low'].sum()/189\nprint(high_average, low_average)\n\n59.333333333333336 37.44444444444444\n\n\nTemperature highs average 59.33 degrees\nTemperature lows average 37.44 degrees\nThats a big range!\nIts also worthwhile to understand how temperatures are progress over the years instead of treating it as a 20 year block. Oftentimes, due to phenomena like global warming, temperatures increase over time. Let’s see if thats the case for Philadelphia over the past few years.\n\nyearly_avg = spring_break.groupby(\"year\")[\"high\"].mean()\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,4))\nplt.plot(yearly_avg.index, yearly_avg.values)\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Average Spring Break High (°F)\")\nplt.title(\"Average Spring Break Temperatures by Year (2005–2025)\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidently, temperatures during the spring break in Philly have almost not moved which seems slightly crazy but the data is clear. This seems unhelpful but rather tells us that we are likely to see a pattern repeat this year, where the average spring break high temperature will be around 59.33 degrees."
